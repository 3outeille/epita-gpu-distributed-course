- Explain column parallel (1 linear)
- Explain row parallel (1 linear)
- Make tiny example forward (1 linear)
- Make tiny example backward (1 linear)
- Combine 2 linears sequentially following each other (video tensor parallel pictoron 1->11:40min)
    - What is the best combination/ordering ?
        - talk about gelu() => can only start Column first
        - Col + Row saves up one Comm
- Apply to transformer modeling in picotron
- Optional: talk about vocab parallel (can check my video)
