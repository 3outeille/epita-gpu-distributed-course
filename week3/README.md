- TODO:
    - Explain column parallel (1 linear)
    - Explain row parallel (1 linear)
    - Make tiny example forward (1 linear)
    - Make tiny example backward (1 linear)
    - Combine 2 linears sequentially following each other
        - What is the best combination/ordering ?
            - talk about gelu() => can only start Column first
            - Col + Row saves up one Comm
    - Apply to transformer modeling in picotron
    - Optional: talk about vocab paralell (can check my video)
